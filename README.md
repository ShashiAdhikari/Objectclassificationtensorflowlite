# Object-Classification-Using-Tensorflow-Lite

1. What is Tensorflow-lite?



Ans:TensorFlow Lite is a set of tools to help developers run TensorFlow models on mobile, embedded, and IoT devices. It enables on-device machine learning inference with low latency and a small binary size.

Classification of objects and deploying it on a Android.

Created a dataset of household objects by clicking 00 images consisting of 10 different object classes.
Trained the neural network on this dataset using EfficientNet-Lite model.
Converted it to Tensorflow Lite format in order to run it on the cellphone.
Deployed it on my Android phone using Android Studio.

!warning while deploying on Android Studio you might face error you can simply search in the stackoverflow and resolve it. I did the same when there was error.
